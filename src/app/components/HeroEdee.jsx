          **Why Now?**

Twenty years ago, in the U.S., 1 in 150 children received a diagnosis of Autism
Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Since then, this number has seen a significant increase,
with 4 in 150 children now being diagnosed with ASD in the U.S. The prevalence of
autism is increasing, and a fundamental aspect of ASD is its diversity. Each individual
with ASD possesses unique needs, preferences, strengths, and challenges.
With generative AI, we believe we now possess the technology to craft limitless user
journeys, tailoring experiences to meet each userâ€™s distinct needs. This sentiment is
further underscored by the findings of over 13,000 research studies, highlighting a
growing inclination towards AI integration in assistive technologies for autism.          </p>
